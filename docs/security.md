# Security: untrusted session content

`ai-reader` is a **read-only** session reader. It has no write surface
and no access-control layer (see
[Architecture -> read-only](architecture.md)). The security concern
is not *who may read* a session -- it is *what the reader's caller does
with the content*.

## Threat model

Agent session logs contain arbitrary text: user prompts, fetched web
pages, tool inputs and outputs, file contents the agent read, and
output from other models. None of this is trusted.

A consumer that feeds session content into an LLM (an auditor, a
summarizer, an orchestrator that replays a session, a reviewer agent)
passes that untrusted text into a model's context. Session content can
and does contain instruction-shaped strings: attempts to override the
consuming model's instructions, tool-call JSON embedded in a fetched
web page, or another agent's reasoning that *describes* a dangerous
command.

A naive consumer treats these as instructions. The model may obey
content that originated inside a session log it was only asked to
*read*. This is prompt injection via session logs.

## This is not theoretical

During the audit that produced this note, a consumer agent that had
read an untrusted session via `read_session` had a Bash action gated
by a prompt-injection guard, which fired correctly. Session logs from
every supported agent (Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Antigravity, Pi)
routinely contain fetches, tool outputs, and cross-agent text -- all
untrusted.

## What `ai-reader` does (and does not)

`ai-reader` is the parser layer. It **does not** sanitize, classify,
or redact instruction-shaped content -- doing so would silently destroy
session fidelity, which defeats the purpose of a reader. Session text
is returned verbatim.

The boundary is deliberate: trust decisions belong to the **consumer**,
not the reader.

## What consumers must do

Treat every string returned by `read_session` / `read_messages` /
`search_sessions` as **untrusted data**, not as instructions:

1. **Frame as data.** Wrap session content so the consuming model
   understands it is a record to analyze, not a directive.
2. **Never auto-execute** a tool call, shell command, or file write
   that originates *inside* session content. Gate every side-effecting
   action behind human approval, and verify the action matches the
   consumer's own task -- not the session's text.
3. **Sandbox the consumer.** Run audit/replay agents with a
   prompt-injection action gate (a hook that blocks risky tools once
   untrusted content has entered context) and minimal filesystem /
   network permissions.
4. **Review cross-agent content twice.** Sessions that reference other
   sessions (via `find_file_edits`, quoted transcripts, or pasted logs)
   chain untrusted sources -- the injection surface compounds.

## `find_file_edits` intent extraction

`find_file_edits` returns an `intent` string mined from the session
that edited a file. That string is session-derived and therefore
untrusted by the same rule: display it, cite it, but do not act on it
as an instruction.

  authorization ("may caller read") was removed because the repo is
  public; this threat model is the *orthogonal* concern -- *what the
  reader's caller does with content*.
